I'll interview you about your project, scan your codebase, and then generate tailored `.kiro/steering/` files so Kiro always has the right context about your project.\n\nWe'll go through three phases:\n1. A short interview (4 rounds of questions about your project, stack, and conventions)\n2. A codebase scan to verify and supplement your answers\n3. Generation of steering markdown files\n\nLet's start with the basics — what is this project? Give me the elevator pitch. Who are the target users? And is this a monorepo or a single project?",
