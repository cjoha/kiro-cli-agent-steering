# Additional Steering Topics

<!-- 
  PLACEHOLDER: Add your custom steering topics here.
  
  These will be loaded as context for the steering-generator agent,
  so it knows about any additional topics you always want covered
  in your steering documents.

  Format: just describe the topic and what the steering file should contain.
  The agent will use this as a reference when generating files.

  Example:
  
  ## Accessibility Standards
  Always generate an accessibility.md steering file that covers:
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance requirements
  - Semantic HTML expectations
  - ARIA usage patterns
  - Keyboard navigation requirements
  - Screen reader testing approach

  ## Git Workflow
  Always generate a git-workflow.md steering file that covers:
  - Branch naming conventions
  - Commit message format
  - PR review process
  - Merge strategy (squash, rebase, etc.)
